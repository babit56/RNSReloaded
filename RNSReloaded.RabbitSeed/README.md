# RabbitSeed

Set the mapseed used for generating runs. Can be used for setseed speedruns, challenge runs, etc. Seed is printed to victory/defeat screens below the "Victory!"/"Defeat!" text, and a chat message is also optionally sent on the first fight
You can set the seed in the mod config. If you just want the seed printing capabilities you can also turn off fixed seed.
Does not limit online play, so only hosts need to install this for seed setting (and clients can optionally install to output seed!)

Thanks to @microwavebunny (on discord) for the original RabbitSeed implementation!

- Add language options when printing map seed
