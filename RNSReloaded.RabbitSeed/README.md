# RabbitSeed

Set the mapseed used for generating runs. Can be used for setseed speedruns, challenge runs, etc. Seed is printed to victory/defeat screens below the "Victory!"/"Defeat!" text, and a chat message is also optionally sent on the first fight.
You can set the seed in the mod config. If you just want the seed printing capabilities you can also turn off fixed seed.

**Limits online play (If fixed seed is turned on)!**. Can be used in vanilla lobbies to see/get the current seed

Thanks to @microwavebunny (on discord) for the original RabbitSeed implementation!

TODO (maybe):
- Add language options for printing map seed
- Set mapseed ingame (via chat)
- Make online limit optional, but require broadcasting setseed to lobby
