# Damage tracker

FFXIV ACT but bad

Use the player buttons (labeled with their in-game names) to select which player you want to see damage stats on.

Expand the "Enemy Select" dropdown to select which enemy you want to see damage stats on. The default is either just damage (including painshared damage) if the main enemy has painshare, otherwise it includes total damage to all enemies (for multi enemy fights)
